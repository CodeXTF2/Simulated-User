# VERY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT
# Simulated User
This project is meant to be a simple, modular framework for running simulated users to generate telemetry for EDRs etc. to facilitate testing of evasion techniques. It can probably also be used for CTF challenges or whatever that require a simulated user.

## Usage
Routines are in /routines. Each routine should be a python file. Add your routine to the init.py yourself.

Configs are provided. They are fairly simple to understand right now, more documentation will be done when this project is further in development.
